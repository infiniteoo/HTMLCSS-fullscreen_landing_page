# HTML/CSS - Easy Full Screen Landing Page

### About

A quick and easy session for a quiet Sunday morning. This project covers the basics of implementing a full screen landing page that is responsive on all screens. Utilizing tools like flexbox and the `100vh` setting, combined with `background-position` and `background-size`, we're able to quickly and easily make a beautiful full screen landing page.
